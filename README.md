## [SpaceX's Falcon 9 A data analysis, visualization, and machine learning model development for on SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches](https://github.com/t-mapa/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone)
Exploring SpaceX Falcon 9 landings. In determining the success of the landings, we will be able to determine the cost of the launches. SpaceX's website states Falcon 9 rocket launches cost around 62 million dollars, while other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. Much of the savings is because Space X is able to reuse the first stage. Therefore, by deteriming if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. Furthermore, by the end, we will create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.

- Presented EDA with visualization and SQL
- Created interactive visual analytics
- Created interactive map with Folium
- Created Plotly Dash dashboard
- Conducted predictive analysis (classification)

# [Visualizing-COVID-19](https://github.com/t-mapa/Visualizing-COVID-19)

##
Visualizing COVID-19 data from the first several weeks of the outbreak to see at what point the virus became a global pandemic; studying how country-wide policies (e.g. shutdowns and quarantines) affect the virus, taking inspiration from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data repository that consilidates information from multiple countries coming from sources like the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Ministry of Health from multiple countries

- Analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases in China verus the rest of the world
- Added a linear trend and logarithmic scale to measure how fast the number of cases is growing and assess how the signifcance of future problems will to be
- Identified the countries that have been hit the hardest

# [Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office](https://github.com/t-mapa/Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office)

## Analyzing the large number of movies and series available on the largest entertainment company by market capitalization; exploring the platform of over 200 million subscribers through the average duration of movies and guest stars from  2011 to 2020

- Created a datagrame from a dictionary
- Conducted data manipulation and created a scatter plot to visualize movies by "year of release"
- Performed an exploratory analysis

# [A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners](https://github.com/t-mapa/A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners)

## Understanding the influences on Nobel prize the determinants of Novel Prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016---from the time the prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused versus the status in the present day

- Used line plot to zero in on USA dominance
- Exploring initial imbalance of men versus women and its status within specific prize categories (e.g. physics, medicine, literature)
- Used linear regression model to understand at what age the prize is usually received within each category and who the oldest and youngest winners are

# [IBM Data Science Professional Course: Applied-Data-Science-Capstone](https://github.com/t-mapa/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone)

### Exploring SpaceX Falcon 9 landings. In determining the success of the landings, we will be able to determine the cost of the launches. SpaceX's website states Falcon 9 rocket launches cost around 62 million dollars, while other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. Much of the savings is because Space X is able to reuse the first stage. Therefore, by deteriming if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. Furthermore, by the end, we will create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.

- Presented EDA with visualization and SQL
- Created interactive visual analytics
- Created interactive map with Folium
- Created Plotly Dash dashboard
- Conducted predictive analysis (classification)

# [Visualizing COVID 19](https://github.com/t-mapa/Visualizing-COVID-19)

### Visualizing COVID-19 data from the first several weeks of the outbreak to see at what point the virus became a global pandemic; studying how country-wide policies (e.g. shutdowns and quarantines) affect the virus, taking inspiration from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data repository that consilidates information from multiple countries coming from sources like the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Ministry of Health from multiple countries.

- Analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases in China verus the rest of the world
- Added a linear trend and logarithmic scale to measure how fast the number of cases is growing and assess how the signifcance of future problems will to be
- Identified the countries that have been hit the hardest

# [Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The-Office](https://github.com/t-mapa/Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office)

### Analyzing the large number of movies and series available on the largest entertainment company by market capitalization; exploring the platform of over 200 million subscribers through the average duration of movies and guest stars from  2011 to 2020.

- Created a datagrame from a dictionary
- Conducted data manipulation and created a scatter plot to visualize movies by "year of release"
- Performed an exploratory analysis

# [A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners](https://github.com/t-mapa/A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners)

### Understanding the influences on Nobel prize the determinants of Novel Prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016---from the time the prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused versus the status in the present day.

- Used line plot to zero in on USA dominance
- Exploring initial imbalance of men versus women and its status within specific prize categories (e.g. physics, medicine, literature)
- Used linear regression model to understand at what age the prize is usually received within each category and who the oldest and youngest winners are

# [The GitHub History of the Scala Language](https://github.com/t-mapa/The-GitHub-History-of-the-Scala-Language)

### Reading in, cleaning up, and visualizing the real world project repository of Scala--one of the most promiminent programming languages for Data Scientists--that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

- Combined data from two separate pull DataFrames.
- Converted the strings with dates in ISO8601 format into Python's DateTime objects, so they can be compared and sorted; converted times in local time to to UTC
- The data used in this project was collected in January of 2018. We are interested in the evolution of the number of contributions up to that date.
- Calculated the number of pull requests submitted each (calendar) month during the project's lifetime; plotted these numbers to see the trend of contributions
- Plotted a chart of the project's activity to explore the evolution of the number of contributions up to the January 2018 (when the data used for this project was collected); plotted a histogram of the number of pull requests submitted by each user to evaluate the dynamics of the community; plotted bar chart that measures experience of developers with code by the number of pull requests submitted that affect that file and how recent those pull requests were submitted

# [The Android App Market on Google Play](https://github.com/t-mapa/The-Android-App-Market-on-Google-Play)

### Conducting a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

- Explored which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market, if any specific category is dominating the market, and which categories have the fewest number of apps; explored relation between app category and app price by looking at how companies and developers are supposed to make ends meet; what monetization strategies companies can use to maximize profit; and what costs of apps are largely based on features, complexity, and platform
- Provided effective approach to come up with strategies to size and price our app by studying: the effect of the size of an app on its rating; users' perception about system-heavy apps vs. light-weighted apps; the effect of price of an app on its rating; users changes in preference when it comes to free vs. paid apps
- Conducted sentiment analysis by plotting sentiment polarity scores of user reviews for paid and free apps

# [Phyllotaxis](https://github.com/t-mapa/Phyllotaxis)

### Drawing flowers using Math. Using R's graphical power to produce artistic images such as phyllotaxis--the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem.

- Drew 50 points on a circle of radius 1 using the Pythagorean trigonometric identity which states that sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1 for any real number θ
- Arranged points in a spiral by multiplying x and y by a factor which increases for each point, through the use of the Golden Angle
- Modified color, transparency, size, and angle of the points to make the image more appealing
